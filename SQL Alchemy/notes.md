SQLAlchemy is a popular Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library. It allows developers to interact with databases using Python classes and objects rather than writing raw SQL queries. By using SQLAlchemy, you can perform database operations (like creating tables, inserting records, updating, or deleting data) in a more Pythonic and object-oriented way, which improves code readability and maintainability.

### Why SQLAlchemy is used with Flask:
1. **Database Abstraction**: SQLAlchemy provides a higher-level, more abstract interface to interact with databases, making it easier for developers to manage database connections, queries, and transactions.
  
2. **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)**: Instead of writing SQL queries, SQLAlchemy allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects and classes. This is especially helpful in Flask applications, where developers can map database tables to Python classes.
   
3. **Flask Extensions**: Flask, a lightweight web framework, doesnâ€™t come with a built-in database support. SQLAlchemy is often used with Flask through an extension called `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, which simplifies the setup and integration of SQLAlchemy with Flask.

4. **Cross-Database Compatibility**: SQLAlchemy supports multiple database engines (like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), so Flask apps can easily switch databases by changing configuration settings without modifying the core database-related code.

### Example Use Case:
In a Flask app, instead of writing raw SQL like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

With SQLAlchemy, you can write:

```python
user = User.query.get(1)
```

__repr__ is a special method used to define a string representation of an object that is mainly intended for developers.
